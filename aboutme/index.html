    <h2>Emmanuel Kusorgbor</h2>
    <h2>Official Banger</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. let me start by introducing myself. My name is Emmanuel Kusorgbor.
    Banger is what my friends call me. I'm Ghanaian and I reside in the capital of the
    country, Accra. People think I'm anti-social. No, I'm not. I just don't want to
    hang out with the wrong people. In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music and
    putting my computer skills to the test.</p>
    <p>I'm responsible for myself, and that began at a very early age. This which
    motivates me to work harder because, in the end, it's just me, myself, and I. I'm not
    a married person. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology and even
    though it hasn't always been easy for me taking up online courses.
    I'm all in for this one.</p>
    <p>Although I haven't done so yet. I truly want to join the church. Okay, I should
    make it clear that even though I haven't been baptized, I fellowship with them in a
    nearby ward. I'm happy to be on this amazing journey with all of you guys on here.
    I would say thanks to BYU.</p>
