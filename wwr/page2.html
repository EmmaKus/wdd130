                    <h2>General FAQs</h2>
                    <h3>Below are some of the recently asked General FAQs.</h3>
                    <h4>What is rafting?</h4>
                    <p>Rafting, also known as whitewater rafting, is a recreational activity that involves
                        navigating a river or other body of water in an inflatable raft. The raft is
                        typically guided by a trained professional or an experienced enthusiast, and can
                        carry several people at once. The activity can range from a calm and easy float
                        down a river to a thrilling, fast-paced ride through challenging rapids. </p>
                        
                    <p>Rafting can be done on a variety of waterways, from gentle streams to powerful rivers
                    with class IV and V rapids. It is a popular activity among adventure-seekers and nature
                    enthusiasts who want to experience the excitement and beauty of the outdoors. It is also
                    a great way to build teamwork and communication skills, as participants must work
                    together to navigate the rapids and ensure everyone's safety.</p>
                    <h4>What should I wear for rafting?</h4>
                    <p>When rafting, it is important to wear appropriate clothing that will keep you
                        comfortable and protected from the elements. Depending on the weather and water
                        conditions, you may want to wear a wetsuit or drysuit, as well as a helmet and
                        personal flotation device (PFD). </p>

                    <p>If you are rafting in colder water or weather, a wetsuit or drysuit will help keep
                        you warm and prevent hypothermia. A helmet is necessary to protect your head in case
                        of a collision or capsize, and a PFD is essential for flotation and safety. You
                        should also wear sturdy shoes with good traction, such as water shoes or sandals
                        with straps, to prevent slipping on rocks or in the raft. Finally, be sure to
                        bring a change of clothes for after the trip, as you will likely get wet.</p>
                    <h4>How difficult is rafting?</h4>
                    <p>The difficulty level of rafting varies depending on the river and the section being
                        rafted. We offer different trips that cater to all skill levels, from beginners to
                        experienced rafters.</p>
                    <h4>Do I need to have any prior experience to go rafting?</h4>
                    <p>Prior experience is not always necessary to go rafting, as it largely depends on the
                        type of rafting you intend to do. For leisurely rafting trips on calm rivers, no
                        previous experience is required as the guides will provide a safety briefing and
                        instructions on how to paddle and navigate the raft. These trips are suitable
                        for beginners and families with children. However, for more challenging rapids
                        and whitewater rafting, prior experience and physical fitness may be necessary.
                        It's important to be honest with yourself and the rafting company about your skill
                        level to ensure you are placed on an appropriate trip. Safety should always be the
                        top priority when participating in any outdoor activity, and it's important to
                        listen to your guides and follow their instructions.</p>
                    <h4>How long does a rafting trip typically last?</h4>
                    <p>The duration of a rafting trip can vary depending on a number of factors such as the
                        length of the river, the difficulty level of the rapids, and the pace of the group.
                        Generally, a half-day trip will last around 3-4 hours, while a full-day trip can
                        last anywhere from 6-8 hours. Multi-day trips can range from two days to a week or
                        more, depending on the itinerary and the length of the river.</p>

                    <p>For half-day and full-day trips, the duration will typically include safety
                        instructions and preparation before launching, the time spent on the river, and time
                        for changing clothes and packing up afterwards. Multi-day trips will often involve
                        camping along the riverbank and may include additional activities such as hiking,
                        fishing, or sightseeing. The duration of these trips will also depend on the number
                        of stops and the amount of time spent at each one. It's important to research and
                        plan ahead to ensure that you have an accurate idea of how long your rafting trip
                        will take.</p>
                    <h4>Is rafting safe?</h4>
                    <p>Rafting can be a safe activity if proper precautions are taken and participants
                        follow the guidelines set by the rafting company or guide. However, as with any
                        outdoor activity, there is always some inherent risk involved.</p>

                    <p>To minimize the risk of injury or accidents, it is important to choose a reputable
                        rafting company or guide with a good safety record. Make sure to follow all safety
                        instructions and wear the appropriate gear, including a helmet and PFD. Be aware of
                        the water conditions and any potential hazards, such as rocks or downed trees, and
                        listen to your guide's instructions on how to navigate around them.</p>
                        
                    <p>If you are a beginner or inexperienced, start with an easier trip on a calmer section
                        of river before progressing to more challenging rapids. It is also important to
                        know your own limits and communicate them to your guide or group. Ultimately, by
                        taking these precautions and being aware of the risks, you can enjoy a fun and
                        safe rafting experience.</p>
                    <h4>What is the minimum age requirement for rafting?</h4>
                    <p>It is important to note that age alone should not be the sole determining factor
                        for participation in rafting trips. Other factors such as physical fitness,
                        swimming ability, and overall health should also be taken into consideration to
                        ensure the safety of participants. It is also important to have proper safety
                        measures in place and to provide participants with adequate training and instruction
                        before embarking on a rafting trip.</p>
                    <h4>Can I bring my own camera or phone on the raft?</h4>
                    <p>We recommend leaving your electronics behind as they may get damaged or lost during the trip.
                        However, we offer photo and video packages for an additional fee.</p>
                    <h4>What if I need to cancel my reservation?</h4>
                    <p>We have a cancellation policy in place that varies depending on the trip and the time of
                        cancellation. Please refer to our website for more information.</p>
                    <h4>What should I bring with me on the rafting trip?</h4>
                    <p>We recommend bringing a change of clothes, a towel, sunscreen, and a water bottle. We provide all
                        the necessary equipment such as life jackets, helmets, and paddles.</p>
                        <h4>Do you offer any discounts or promotions?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, we offer discounts for groups, students, and military personnel. Please refer to our website
